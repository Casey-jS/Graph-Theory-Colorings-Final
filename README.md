# Graph-Theory-Colorings-Final
Final MTH 325 Project - Graph theory colorings problem set

Includes functionality to:
  1. Determine if a graph is proper
  2. Generate all possible colorings of a graph using at most 3 colors
  3. Determine if a graph is 3-colorable
  4. Determine if a graph is a proper edge coloring
  5. Use traditional greedy algorithm

Uses only copy.deepcopy() from external libraries
